# Mask Classification Project
<img src = "banner.png" />
The project involves our team of four members to develop a convolutional neural network for the classification of the people wearning mask and it's relevant information such as if it is a procedural or cloth mask. 


## Process involved in the Model Training
1. Data Gathering. 
2. Evaulation and cleaning the existing datasets and applying the preprocessing to obtain the optimal results.
3. Convolutional Neural Network Model Training.
4. Analyse the performance of the model with the confusion matrix. 

## Libraries. 
<ul>
    <li> Pytourch </li>
    <li> Matplotlib </li>
    <li> Sklearn </li>
    <li> Numpy</li>
</ul>

All the above packages can be installed directly using Anaconda Installer which will also install Jupyter notebooks present in the ```instructions.txt``` file. Anaconda downloader can be downloaded from [Download Link](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
